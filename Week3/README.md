## Learning activities and resources
For the assignment in the third week, because the assignment requirement is to master using wordpress to build a web page, I chose to develop a cake website similar to the one made by Joomla. There is almost no difference in the content of the web pages. Since the assignment requires the use of WordPress as the content management system, I mainly learned WordPress through LinkedIn Learning and YouTube.

LinkedIn Learning Video I Learned WORDPRESS
YouTube Video I Learned WORDPRESS


## time
I started learning WordPress through one-hour tutorials on LinkedIn and YouTube. After learning the WordPress interface and tools, I started building the website as described above. The development process lasted about a day. After the website was built, I also learned how to set it as the main interface.

## Content Insights
In the second week of the project, I started making a cake shop web page, which was almost identical to the one I created in the first week. I use wordpress as my content management system and have spent time understanding its intricacies through resources on LinkedIn Learning and YouTube.

## Learning Insights
Learning Insights: Learning WordPress with LinkedIn Learning and YouTube reveals the power of self-directed learning in acquiring new skills. There are two different platforms I can use to build web pages.
