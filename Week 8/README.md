## This is an 8-round research itinerary, integrating research activity resources, research time, content review, and research comments.

This week, Our Team Is Developing a Website for the James Cook University Open House as part of our group projects.

# learningjourney
- Academic events and resources  
This week I did part of the a2 homework, and I made the ppt part. My team members produced other parts, we used slack to communicate, and used trello to outline and record our discussions. Edited LinkedIn profile.    
I learned how to record videos using YouTube, how to use trello, and learned wordpress again.

# Website description
Create an open house website for James Cook University, Singapore SMART Goal:  

##### Improve acceptance rate goals:

- Increase our website acceptance rate by 6% between January 15 and 21, 2024.
- The aim is to increase open day attendance by 12% during that time period.
#### Measurable tracking strategies:

- Employ advanced analytics tools to monitor website traffic and user engagement.
- Set up a detailed user registration and activity tracking system to collect data more accurately.
#### Implementation Plan:

- Improve website performance with a preferred hosting service to ensure a smooth user experience.
- Implement effective search engine optimization (SEO) strategies to increase your website's online visibility and attract more target audiences.
- Increase public awareness and participation in our activities through social media platforms and customized marketing campaigns.
#### Relevance and user engagement:

- Optimize website content to ensure it is highly relevant and attractive to potential students and visitors.
- Integrate more interactive elements and virtual exhibitions to enhance the user experience and better showcase the features and strengths of our university.
#### Time limits and evaluation:

- During and after the Open House, analyze data periodically to evaluate whether established goals were achieved.
- After the event, conduct detailed analysis to evaluate the overall performance of the website against set acceptance and attendance goals

# Establish a testing strategy

- In the process of completing this project, I deeply understood the importance of building a strong testing strategy for website development. This experience not only deepened my understanding of WordPress and the code development process, but also taught me the importance of choosing the right hosting service and working with a collaborative team in website development. But the most important thing is that I learned how to accurately formulate and execute testing methods, which became a turning point in my career.

- Testing plays a central role in the website development process, ensuring the stability and functionality of the website. I came to realize that a systematic approach to testing is the cornerstone of a successful website. This includes not only unit testing for each unit component, but also integration testing to evaluate the interaction between different modules, and user acceptance testing (UAT) to ensure that the final product meets customer needs.

- I learned not only the technical aspects of testing, but also its value in identifying and solving problems early on. A comprehensive testing strategy is critical to maintaining code quality and preventing potential issues from spreading to production. I realized that when testing is effectively integrated into the development process, it can significantly improve the overall robustness of the website and provide a better experience for users.

- Additionally, I also learned the importance of developing test cases that comprehensively cover various scenarios and edge cases. Effective testing combined with regular feedback not only optimizes the code base but also improves the overall performance and reliability of the website.

- Going forward, I will be applying the lessons learned on this project about testing strategies to future web development projects. I truly believe that nuanced testing is the cornerstone of building successful and resilient websites, and this philosophy will continue to guide my career path.

# Content explanation
Completed the a2 assignment, collaborated on the wordpress project, and created a LinkedIn profile.

# Study Guide
- Through the successful implementation of this project, I gained valuable experience and insights on multiple levels of web development. This experience deepened my understanding of WordPress and allowed me to master every detail from content management to theme customization and plug-in integration. This not only improved my technical skills, but also taught me the importance of flexible tool selection based on project needs.

- In the process of code development, I experienced an important growth process. My programming skills have improved significantly and I have explored in depth both front-end and back-end development. This experience particularly emphasized the importance of writing clean, efficient, and maintainable code. Through iterative development, I not only learned frequent commits and collaborative reviews of code, but also gained a deep understanding of version control and Git workflow.

- Additionally, choosing the right hosting solution is key to project success. Now I understand better how important hosting is to website performance, scalability, and user experience. Evaluating different hosting options, understanding server configurations, and optimizing websites for speed and security have become core parts of my skill set.

- Working with team members such as Zar Chi Oo, Myat Pwint Phyu and Kaung Sat Paing has been one of the most productive experiences on this project. They bring diverse skills and perspectives that make team collaboration more effective. This teamwork experience provides opportunities for effective communication, task distribution and mutual support in achieving project goals. It also highlights that successful web development relies not only on individual technical ability, but also on team collaboration and unity.

- Overall, the project was an all-encompassing learning journey that touched on everything from technical knowledge to key decision-making. Not only did I expand my technical knowledge base, I also developed a deep understanding of the interrelationships between the various elements needed to make a web development project successful.
