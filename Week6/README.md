##This is the 6th round of learning itinerary, which combines learning activity resources, learning time, content review, and learning review.

# Part 6: Learning Journey
-Academic activities and resources
In this assignment, we set up a github classroom, a trello board, and created and joined the group's Slack for communication.

We spent 2 hours setting up and joining slack, trello and github groups. After using the trello template, adding the content took 2 hours.

#contentinterpretation
Joined the slack group to facilitate communication on future group assignments and improve the efficiency of production projects. After joining github classroom, we can put the code into the project library and use it together. The trello board can create an outline, make a plan, and clearly know every step of the plan.

#StudyGuide
In the process of joining the group, I learned how to use slack to communicate (I had never used it before) and learned to use trello board to make plans.
