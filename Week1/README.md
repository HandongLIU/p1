## First week of learning journey

## Learning Activities and Resources

During my first week of practice, I decided to create a cake shop website. Since this week's assignment is to actually use HTML and CSS to build a website, I referenced JCU's Web Design and Development course materials for modifications. In order to precisely customize certain areas or features of the website, I also looked into the w3schools website. Additionally, I watched video tutorials on LinkedIn Learning to apply advanced CSS techniques to give the website a more dynamic and interactive design.

## Time

I dedicated two and a half days to this project. The first day was focused on content planning and building learning paths, including setting SMART goals for the website and defining learning activities. The next day I focused on writing HTML and CSS code to build the basic structure and styling of the website. Finally, I spent the third day checking and polishing all the details to make sure everything was running smoothly.

## Content Insights

My cake shop aims to provide customers with a rich selection of desserts and personalized cake customization services. Through my website , customers can explore a variety of cakes and pastries, admire exquisite cake designs, and learn the story of our cakes. I am committed to providing a high quality online service that allows customers to easily order and customize their desired cake. So I created a web page to facilitate customers to place orders.

## Learning Insights

In this project, I deepened my knowledge of HTML and CSS by leveraging resources from w3schools and LinkedIn Learning. While my future career path may not directly involve the technical intricacies of front-end or back-end development, understanding these basics has given me a deeper understanding of website development. While these skills are not my primary career focus, they have improved my technical skills and given me a more comprehensive view of website development.
