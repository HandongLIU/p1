## Learning activities and resources
For the assignment in the second week, I chose to develop a cake website similar to the one I made in the first week. The interface of the website will be simpler and the animation when sliding will be smoother. Since the assignment required Joomla as a content management system, I learned Joomla mainly through LinkedIn Learning and YouTube.

## time
I started learning Joomla through one-hour tutorials on LinkedIn and YouTube. After learning Joomla's interface and tools, I started building the website as described earlier. The development process lasted about a day. After building the website, I also learned how to set it as the main interface.

## Content insights
In the second week of the project, I started making a cake shop web page, which was almost identical to what I created in the first week. I use Joomla as my content management system and have spent time understanding its intricacies through resources on LinkedIn Learning and YouTube.

## Learn insights
Learning Insights: Learning Joomla with LinkedIn Learning and YouTube reveals the power of self-directed learning in acquiring new skills. This experience reinforced the value of leveraging diverse learning resources and platforms to promote a comprehensive understanding of a new tool or technology.
