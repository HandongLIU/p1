## Learning activities and resources
For the fourth week's homework, because the homework requirement is to build a local database, I chose to use XAMPP to build it. Due to my homework, I need to use WordPress as a content management system, so I mainly learned XAMPP to build databases and WordPress through LinkedIn Learning and YouTube.
